            <p className='w-full text-justify'>
                rt-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) analysis is a lab technique used to find and measure RNA in a sample. First, it converts RNA into DNA, and then it makes many copies of that DNA to make it easier to detect. This method is commonly used in medicine to test for viruses, like COVID-19, and to study how genes are expressed in different conditions. Itâ€™s a valuable tool for understanding biological processes and diagnosing diseases.

            <p>
              Conventional HRMA workflows depend heavily on expert manual analysis, often prone to interpretation errors and time-consuming
              due to the high complexity of genetic data. Mid to large-sized labs face additional hurdles with vendor-dependent software
              and inconsistent analytical tools.

            <h2 className="text-2xl mb-4 font-light tracking-tighter">Data Processing Pipeline</h2>
            <p>
              The PyMLRS pipeline uses raw fluorescence data from PCR devices, followed by smooth filtering via Savitzky-Golay
              algorithms, and logical thresholding to identify DNA melt peaks. Each step is optimized to enhance analysis quality
              and reliability, streamlining processes for high-throughput labs.
